# js-apps-spa-movieCatalogue
 
A simple SPA exercise using only vanilla JS and a simple express server. The app supports basic CRUD operations, login/logout & register of new users and keeps a collection of movies, which can be modified. Logged-in users are able to view, add movies and like/dislike movies. Logged-in users should also be able to edit or delete only the movies they have added, but are not able to like/dislike them.

# Prerequisites

Open the **start.bat** file in the server directory to execute the service, or manually open a command prompt and run `node server.js`, then open the app with live-server, lit-server or any other built-in live server.

*Note that changes to the data are not permanent and will be wiped when the service is restarted.
